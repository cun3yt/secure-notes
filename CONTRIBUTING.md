This structure follows these principles:

- Feature-first organization in components
- Route-based organization in app directory
- Clear separation of frontend and backend
- Utility functions grouped by purpose
- Configuration files at root level
- Documentation and reference files clearly separated

## Testing

Please read [testing-instructions.md](testing-instructions.md) for details on how to write tests for the backend.
